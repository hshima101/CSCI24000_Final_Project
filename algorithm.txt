Goal:
Create a program that can emulate a shop.
The program should be able to hold multiple objects with
the variables (Buy/Sale Price, Buy Price, Quantity).
These objects will be stored in an arraylist that will hold 
every single item that is created.

Items that are sold will be recorded then stored on another
array where a report can be made.

After all items have been reported, the program will
start asking the user to report sales. the user will see what 
is in their inventory and then will be asked to report 
what items were sold for that day. All of the items 
reported will be placed in a different list that will be used to 
calculate profits/losses, gross, inventory cost, and an average on items sold.

this will be done using arraylists to keep track of all the
items the user will put in their inventory and the items
sold from the inventory.
